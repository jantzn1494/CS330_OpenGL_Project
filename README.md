# CS330_OpenGL_Project
3D Scene in OpenGL


How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  The coursework this semester was designed to start with the basics of OpenGL and continue to add and modify the code to completion of the project. I believe that I generally use techniques surrounding object-oriented design to encapsulate and modularize the code so that it is readable and efficient. This project has pushed me to do that in order to keep the source code for the main function readable and organized. There are many personalized classes within the code that have been used for my purposes during this project. However they can easily be translated to another project because they are all separated by header files.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  I approach programs through understanding of functionality first and breaking things into classes and other objects in order to keep the code neat and reusable. Iteration was definitely a factor in creation of the vectors of vertices used to store the points used during the rendering cycle in the main function. My approach changed as the milestones became more complex, leading to new challenges. I often had to modify the code before building upon the previous milestone because I did not completely understand the OpenGL structure until I arrived at the current milestone.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

  Computer science involves the development of many skills such as time management, stress management, organization, critical thinking, and problem solving. Computational graphics and visualizations give me some knowledge to work with other developers and to understand the mindset of those dealing with the field directly.
